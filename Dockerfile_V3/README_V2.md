This versi√≥n is deployed using Docker compose and dockerized a database to conecction with Django App:

- The docker-compose.yml file is created with necessary configuration.  

## Create image and container

## TO DO
`settings.DEBUG` is in `True`, in `False` no working inside docker and i think that i should correct it.
